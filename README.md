BeamNG.Drive mod that adds transmissions with gear ratios from real vehicles, an assortment of engines, and various other supporting parts to the vanilla vehicles of BeamNG. Corrections of transmission ratios and suggestions for features are always apprectiated.

A Google Sheet of transmission ratios for real world vehicles can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qRxUFQiwtekj9uj9fpbIDEh-Vlj6mX8xcVFqOVqPFqE/edit?usp=sharing) for personal use. Feel free to use it for your own BeamNG mods. As of writing this, it contains 608 ratios. Some ratios may be repeated, I'm only human.
